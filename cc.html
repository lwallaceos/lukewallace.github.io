      <p>
        I am a Computer Science student with skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
        Python, and SQL. I have experience working with libraries and frameworks
        like NumPy and pandas, enabling me to analyze and process data
        efficiently. I enjoy coding across various domains and tackling
        challenging projects. I am currently seeking internship opportunities to
        apply my technical expertise, gain hands-on experience, and contribute
        to impactful solutions. My goal is to continuously improve as a
        developer while delivering effective results.
