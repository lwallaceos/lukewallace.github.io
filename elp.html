      <h4>Personal Programming Experience</h4>
      <p>
        - I have extensive experience working with various programming
        languages, particularly Python, which I have used for data analysis,
        automation, and scripting. I frequently leverage libraries like
        <strong>Pandas</strong> for data manipulation and
        <strong>NumPy</strong> for numerical computation in engineering and
        technical projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        - I have developed and optimized SQL queries for managing and extracting
        data from relational databases, ensuring efficient data retrieval and
        processing for analysis and reporting purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        - My programming skills are complemented by a strong foundation in
        algorithms, data structures, and version control using Git, which I
        apply in both academic and professional settings to solve complex
        engineering and data-related challenges.
