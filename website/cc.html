      <p>
        I am a passionate Computer Science student with a strong interest in
        programming and problem-solving. I enjoy exploring new technologies,
        writing different kinds of code, and tackling complex challenges.
        Currently, I am seeking internship opportunities to apply my skills,
        gain hands-on experience, and contribute meaningfully to innovative
        projects. My goal is to continuously grow as a developer while making a
        positive impact in the tech world.
